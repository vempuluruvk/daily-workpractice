    <p>My friends People live in society. Hence we cannot identify with those who live near us and work with us. 
        This acquaintance sometimes turns into friendship.</p><p>You will not find friendless people. Even monks have friends. 
        I also have friends. Peter is my close friend. He is my friend since childhood. </p>
